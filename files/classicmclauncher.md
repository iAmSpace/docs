# Do I log in with my email or username?

You log in with your email address if you purchased Minecraft after November 2012 and migrated to a Microsoft account, migrated your old account (Mojang/Username) to a Microsoft account, or purchased Minecraft after November 2021.

It used to be that you would log in with your username if you have an older Minecraft account, and have not yet migrated to the new account format. Now, with Microsoft account migration being absolutely neccessary you can no longer do this. If you have an account of which you logged in with the username, you will need to migrate that account to a Microsoft account.

Keep in mind that it is possible to have multiple accounts, your old Minecraft account doesn't automatically migrate to a Microsoft account, even if you register with the same email address. If you log in with an account that does not contain a paid copy of Minecraft, only the demo mode will be accessible.

# Change or forgot password

**It is now no longer possible to change the password of old Mojang or username accounts, you need to have migrated to a Microsoft account.**

The forgot password system goes through Microsoft, link of which can be found [here](https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx). If you have any issues regarding resetting your password please contact Microsoft support for help. You may need to provide further details.
